## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **M0** — Nix flake providing Elixir 1.20 / OTP 29, Rust, and a ROCm-free
  tinygrad worker Python environment. Project scaffolding, device-string parsing
  (`ExTinygrad.Device`), dtype mapping (`ExTinygrad.Dtype`), a standalone Python
  device probe (`priv/worker/device.py`), and a `no-rocm-closure` flake check.
- **M1** — XTG1 framed wire protocol (`ExTinygrad.Protocol` / `priv/worker/protocol.py`),
  a supervised Erlang Port worker (`ExTinygrad.Worker`) with monotonic generation
  tracking and crash isolation, worker-side buffer registry and stats, and the
  `hello`, `device_info`, `upload`, `download`, `release`, `stats`, `synchronize`,
  and `shutdown` commands.
